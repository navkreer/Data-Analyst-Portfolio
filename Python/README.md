# Project 1: Statistical Techniques for Sleep Quantity/Quality using ANOVA and Caffeine Consumption Survey Analysis

##Goal: 
To apply statistical techniques to analyze sleep quantity and quality using ANOVA, and to analyze caffeine consumption patterns based on survey data, with a focus on understanding the relationship between various factors like sleep quality, caffeine intake, and demographic information.

##Description:
The project consists of two parts:
1. Sleep Quantity/Quality using ANOVA: Analyzing the effects of different factors (e.g., age, gender, lifestyle) on sleep quantity and quality. The analysis uses ANOVA to assess whether there are statistically significant differences between groups.
2. Caffeine Consumption Survey Analysis: Examining caffeine consumption patterns from a survey, with a focus on understanding factors such as the amount of caffeine consumed, age groups, and lifestyle habits. The analysis include descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to explore relationships.
Key steps include: Data Loading, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and ANOVA.

##Skills:
- ANOVA
- Statistical Analysis
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Descriptive Statistics

##Results:
- ANOVA results showing whether factors like age, gender, and lifestyle significantly affect sleep quality and quantity.
- Interpretation of the F-statistic and p-values to determine statistical significance.
- Visualizations like box plots or bar graphs to show differences in sleep quality/quantity across groups.
- Summary of caffeine consumption patterns across different demographic groups, with visual representations.
- Statistical results from tests (e.g., t-tests and chi-square tests)
- Insights into the relationship between caffeine intake and sleep quality/quantity, with potential recommendations or conclusions based on the findings.

# Project 2: VCT Analysis and Visualizations

##Goal:
To analyze Valorant eSports tournament data, exploring key factors such as player performance, team dynamics, earnings, and agent roles, using data analysis techniques and visualizations to derive insights into the relationships between these variables and tournament success.

##Description: 
The dataset includes detailed information from various Valorant tournaments, including player statistics (kills, deaths, assists), team performance, earnings, and the agents chosen by players. The project involves exploring these factors to understand their impact on tournament outcomes. Key steps include data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors affecting performance. Key steps include: data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors affecting performance.

##Skills:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Data exploration and pattern recognition

##Results: 
Various graphs and plots showing the distribution of player statistics, team earnings, and the impact of agent selection on tournament results. Key observations about factors affecting team success, such as the most effective agents, player roles, and team earnings. For example, analysis could reveal which player stats (e.g., kills, assists) correlate most strongly with tournament wins or earnings. Identification of significant patterns, such as how teams with higher earnings perform across different stages of a tournament or how the choice of agent affects match outcomes. Summary of key metrics and insights from descriptive statistics, including any interesting correlations between player performance and team outcomes.
