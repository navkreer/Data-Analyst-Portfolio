# California Real Estate Analysis and Predictions

## Goal: 
To predict California real estate prices and analyze key factors affecting them, including ocean proximity, location, and housing specifications such as the number of rooms, using regression and data analysis.

## Description: 
The dataset contains real estate listings from California, including variables such as the number of rooms, location, ocean proximity, housing age, and other features. The project involves predicting house prices using these variables and performing regression analysis to understand the relationship between house features and their market price. Key steps include: data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, regression modeling, and performance evaluation.

## Skills: 
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Regression analysis
- Data visualization with ggplot2
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Results:
Regression models that predict real estate prices based on housing attributes (e.g., number of rooms, proximity to the ocean, and location). Data visualizations highlighting trends and patterns, such as price distributions by location, room counts, and proximity to the ocean. Insights derived from regression analysis about the most significant predictors of housing prices in California. For example, the impact of ocean proximity, number of rooms, and geographic location on pricing. Model performance evaluation (e.g., R-squared, RMSE) and potential recommendations for future housing investments or policy-making.


# Understanding Economic Development - Analysis of GDP and Extractive Institutions

## Goal: 
To analyze the relationship between GDP growth and the characteristics of extractive institutions, using Bayesian modeling and Monte Carlo simulations to inform more effective policies for sustainable economic development.

## Description:
This project examines the relationship between economic development, as measured by GDP growth, and extractive institutions, such as oil producers, education quality, literacy rates, and population growth. The dataset includes historic GDP values, characteristics of extractive institutions (e.g., presence of oil production, school ratings, literacy rates), and demographic factors (e.g., population growth rate). Key steps include: Data Loading & Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Implementing Bayesian techniques to model the relationship between GDP and extractive institutions, incorporating uncertainty and prior knowledge, Simulating new data points to explore various scenarios and assess the impact of extractive institutions on GDP growth, Model Evaluation.

## Skills:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Bayesian modeling techniques
- Monte Carlo simulations for data modeling
- Data visualization with ggplot2
- Model evaluation and performance assessment

## Results:
A Bayesian model that estimates the relationship between GDP growth and extractive institutions, considering various economic, demographic, and institutional factors.
Monte Carlo simulations to predict potential GDP growth under various hypothetical scenarios, accounting for uncertainty in the data. Visualizations to illustrate key relationships, such as the impact of oil production on GDP, and how school and literacy ratings influence economic growth. Insights derived from Bayesian analysis about the influence of extractive institutions on GDP, and how these institutions may hinder or promote sustainable development. Policy recommendations for addressing the adverse effects of extractive institutions and fostering long-term economic growth.
